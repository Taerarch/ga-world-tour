## Summary
The idea of the project was to render the data from the BandsInTown API onto a world map and provide a helpful vizualisation of the data.
We used React to create the frontend and Firebase for the database storing user data such as their liked tour dates, details as well as camera for a profile picture.


The inbuilt functions from the map allowed us to handle the color changing as well as the drop down information for mouseover on countries.
